It all started when I arrived at the Flughafen for my first trip to Germany.
I walked out of the airport and my taxi driver was wearing a leather jacket and Lederhose.
Immediately, I requested to the driver to take me to the biergarten.
On the way, a Klimaanlage fell out of a window and hit the front of the car!
Why did the Bratwurst start a protest at Raesfeld Flughafen Berlin on Hauptstrasse? It felt it was unfairly grilled by the competition!
